# Vue Coding Challenge


### It's in your best interest to read this before you begin:
It's okay if you've never seen a vue app before!! That's the point. You're being tested on how well you do when you're <i>outside</i> of your comfort zone. Don't worry about anything in the `<template>` section or the `<style>` section. The only code that you need to touch will be in the `<script>` section. Even better, the methods that you need to use are already there. You just have to make them work. Try to complete as many of the deliverables as possible, but it's okay if you don't get them all. They also aren't in any particular order.

## Premise
I love my dog. I love everything about him. Like the fact that he is definitely real and this picture of him is most certainly not from a free stock photo website. I love him so much, that I've created this site for him. The only purpose of this site is for people to be able to comment on this one very real image of my very real pupper.

## Deliverables:

- When a comment's "remove" button is clicked, that comment should be removed from the page.
- Only real comments allowed. An empty comment should not be added to the list.
- I only want to see 5 comments. If there are already 5 comments on the page, a user should have to delete one before being able to add another.

### Bonus!!
Right now, if there are multiple comments that are identical, they will all be deleted when you try to delete one. If you can (and you've completed all of the deliverables), try to make it so that only the selected comment is removed and all the other ones remain- even if they are identical.

**Note:** In order to complete the bonus, you will need to touch some of the code inside the `<template>` section of one of the components.
