# Vue Coding Challenge


### It's okay if you've never seen a vue app before!!
That's the point. You're being tested on how well you do when you're <i>outside</i> of your comfort zone. Don't worry about anything in the `<template>` section or the `<style>` section. The only code that you need to touch will be in the `<script>` section. Even better, the methods that you need to use are already there. You just have to make them work.

## Premise
I love my dog. I love everything about him. Like the fact that he is definitely real and this picture of him is most certainly not from a free stock photo website. I love him so much, that I've created this site for him. The only purpose of this site is for people to be able to comment on my pupper. I think that they will only have really nice things to say about him, but just incase anyone does say anything negative, I want to be able to delete any of their comments if I don't like them.

## Deliverables:

- When a comment's "remove" button is clicked, that comment should be removed from the page.
- Only real comments allowed. An empty comment should not be added to the list.

#### Bonus: 
I only want to see 5 comments. If there are already 5 comments on the page, a user should have to delete one before being able to add another.
